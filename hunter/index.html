        <strong class="p-2">...I'm addicted to Bikes</strong>
        <p class="p-2"> One of my oldest childhood memories is of receiving a green Schwinn bike that sported giant “ape hanger” handlebars & a gold banana seat with glittery sparkles. I loved that bike & must have ridden it 10 miles a day. That was the beginning of
          my love-affair with bikes. I stacked boards on top of rocks to make jumps, chipping one of my new adult eye-teeth on those big handlebars during a one jump attempt. 40 years later, my tooth still has that chip. As a 4th grader, I saved money
          & split the cost of a caramel-colored Huffy 10-speed with my parents. I rode that bike until I reached high school.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="p-2">At 14 yrs old, I got my 1st job: salesman at a local hardware store. I worked for an entire summer to purchase my 1st “boutique” cycle…a plum colored Fuji 12 speed road bike. I loved that bike; it flew like the wind. I’d ride my Fuji & dream that
          I could rip as fast as Dave Stoller, the cycling-obsessed character in the 1979 movie Breaking Away. During the Summer, I’d ride more than 30 miles a day in the “cycling gear” of the early 80s, my cut-off jeans & a t-shirt…no helmet. As a Utah
          college student, I began making payments on a new road bike. However, the first mountain bikes showed-up at the bike shop & I switched my payments to a pair of Haros. A week before my marriage I paid them off. For our honeymoon, my wife & I
          went to Aspen Colorado to ride the trails. Later, as a PhD candidate in Canada, I purchased my 1st full-suspension bike, a bright red Trek “Y” frame bike. It went with me when I moved back to Utah to start my career teaching at the University.

        <p class="p-2">As I began my teaching career, I also initiated a part-time career in biking. With another teacher-- who was also a cyclist--I founded Kokopelli Tours. We specialized in guided mountain biking trips to southern Utah. The trips took place during
          weekends, holidays & during the summer months; they offered me a chance to get paid for riding my bike. The business also earned me a sponsorship through a local bike shop. This helped to defray the cost of parts for my new mango colored GT
          I-Drive full suspension mountain bike. Eventually, the tour business evolved into Core Performance Cycles, a bicycle manufacturing company. CPC focused on building extreme down-hill & all-mountain bikes. We had two models: (1) The Bad Hair Day,
          a super sick down-hill bike; and (2) the Buzz Cutt, a 6” travel all-mountain bike. Our custom-built DH bikes were used by “big hit” riders around the country. One of our bikes even appeared in Mountain Biking UK magazine.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">When I moved to NWA, I began looking for trails & people with whom to ride. I found a small— but growing--mountain biking community & began the POD (Picture Of the Day), a daily e-mail blast designed to unify local mountain bikers & keep them
          informed about the local biking scene. Each POD includes: pictures of exciting biking action, weather reports, trail condition updates, info on upcoming trail rides & info on local trails & trail maintenance. Also, as a member of the Unilever
          ales team, I initiated the NWA Degree triathlon & mountain biking teams. For these teams, I acquired needed funding to outfit the riders, designed the uniforms & managed race plans. I also orchestrated Unilever’s sponsorships for local triathlons.</p>
