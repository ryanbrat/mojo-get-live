    <p>Bentonville is a great location for casual & sport riders. New paved trails & bike routes seem to open every month for you to explore! Traditional locations like Lake Bella Vista still beckon to riders. But new options will soon expand your riding
      experience. The newly-created route under Hwy 540 links Lake Bella Vista’s trail to the North Bentonville Trail. Once you’re in Bentonville, many options become available: you can ride along currently expanding trails like the Heritage Trail or
      the Arkansas-Missouri Trail. You can also follow regional greenways on the South Bentonville Trail. Soon, these routes will be linked to an ever-expanding system that will take you all the way to Fayetteville…without ever having to ride on the street!
      To best enjoy your ride, be sure to choose the right type of Sport & Fitness bike.</p>

      <p><strong>Sport & Fitness (SF):</strong> Sport & Fitness cycles (previously know as a “Hybrids”) are used for cross-training, trekking & commuting on a wide variety of surfaces, including: paved roads, unpaved roads, paths, & light trails. SF bikes
        combine features from the road bike & the mountain bike (hence their original name…Hybrid). Variants such as the city bike, trekking bike, cross bike, comfort bike & commuter have differences that are specific to the riding styles they are built
        to support. Generally, however, SF bikes use a mountain bike's triple crank & its flat handlebars, giving riders a more upright & comfortable posture than road bicycles. SF bikes can feature rim or disc brakes, depending on what the rider needs.
        SF bikes often take the 700c (larger) road wheel diameter from road bikes. This provides less rolling resistance for higher speeds. However, they usually use a wider rim & tire for increased strength.</p>

      <p><strong>Cruiser:</strong> Cruiser bikes (also known as beach cruisers) feature large balloon tires, upright seating posture & flowing, expressive, styling. Cruisers are as much about style & comfort as they are about transportation. Most popular
        in the early 1930s through the 1950s, Cruisers have enjoyed renewed popularity since the late 1990s. New cruiser bike iterations have moved away from their single-speed heritage & now provide comfortable three speed, & even seven speed, options.
        These multi-speed options help them to be comfortable on longer rides. Their “retro” look, reliable mechanical performance, comfortable ride, & relatively low price make them a great option for folks who need a cycle for leisurely rides. ​</p>
