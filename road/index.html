    <p>Road riding has been a passion for riders for nearly 150 years & racing events began as an organized sport in 1868. Events like the Tour de France have highlighted the road bike. As such, most folks are familiar with their race-bred form. At first glance, these bikes all look similar. However, within the discipline of road riding there are different types of bicycle geometries; each variant focuses on the specific needs of the rider. Think of your bike as a tool. If you get the correct tool for the job, the job will go more quickly & smoothly. Here are the most popular tools for the job:</p>

      <p><strong>Race Geometry:</strong> Conventional wisdom among road bike designers holds that for every inch a rider lowers their upper body over the front wheel, the rider can travel roughly one mph faster with the same wattage output from their legs, while at a constant cadence. It’s all about reduced wind drag. What this means is that a race geometry is all about getting low over the front of the bike. To accomplish this, race bikes feature a slightly longer top tube that is parallel to the ground. These features stretch the rider out, keeping their torso low over the bike. Being low over the bike helps reduce your drag, but it also places increased stress on your lower back. As such, race geometries are not as comfortable for longer rides.​</p>

      <p><strong>Sport Geometry:</strong> Sport bikes feature the most popular geometry for road bikes. This is because they focus on creating a long distance & cross-training riding platform by providing a “relaxed” body position that places no pressure on the rider’s lower back. The relaxed position is accomplished because designers are not as concerned with reducing wind resistance. Thus, the cycle’s top tube is shorter & usually graduates up from the seat post to the headset. This sits the rider a bit taller over the bike. Riders will “catch” a little more wind, but their body position is more comfortable…especially for long rides. Many Racers & Tri riders train on Sport bikes for comfort & then compete on more aggressive Race or Tri bike geometries.​​</p>

      <p><strong>Triathlon Geometry:</strong> ﻿Conventional wisdom among Triathlon & Time Trial bike designers holds that for every inch a rider lowers their upper body over the front wheel, the rider can travel roughly one mph faster with the same wattage output from their legs, while at a constant cadence. It’s all about reduced wind drag. Reduced wind drag is of premier importance to Triathlon racers. In many cases, a Tri rider will ride a slightly heavier bike, if it reduces wind resistance. This means that Triathlon geometries are all about getting extremely low over the bike’s front wheel. To accomplish this, Tri bikes feature top tubes that are parallel to the ground, or actually drop down from the seat post to the headset. This lowered top tube is combined with tri bars which are attached to the bike’s handlebars. Tri bars help riders to lie over the top of the bike, reducing wind resistance even more than that provided by Race Geometry bikes. These features dramatically stretch the rider out, keeping their torso low over the bike. Being low over the bike helps reduce your drag, but it also places increased stress on your lower back. As such, Tri geometries are not as comfortable for long rides & climbing steep hills can be difficult.</p>
